# This is a sample input file that matches the example scenario described
# in the section of the project write-up titled "The simulation model".

# These are the four devices from that example
DEVICE 1
DEVICE 2
DEVICE 3
DEVICE 4


# These are the propagation rules described in that example
PROPAGATE 1 2 750
PROPAGATE 2 3 1250
PROPAGATE 3 4 500
PROPAGATE 4 1 1000


# Here, we have the one scheduled alert and its subsequent cancellation
